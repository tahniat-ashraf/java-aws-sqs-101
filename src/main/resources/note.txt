If items are not deleted from queue, they get back into the queue after visibility timeout is over

for max messages = 3
Let's say 1.1,1.2 and 1.3 is fetched from queue
where 1 is their common message group id
and 1,2 & 3 are their deduplication id

if these are not deleted and they get back into the queue,
in the next poll, what we observe is the consumer will start fetching from 1.3 (the last item)
if there's also 1.4 and 1.5 in the queue, there's a high chance that in the next poll, the consumer
will get 1.3,1.4 and 1.5. 1.1 and 1.2 isn't picked anymore. Why is that?
